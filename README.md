### Project Description
This project provides a single, self-contained HTML page that functions as a Markdown to HTML converter with syntax highlighting for code blocks. It takes Markdown content (provided as an embedded string from `input.md`) and renders it as styled HTML within a designated output area. The page uses the `marked` library for Markdown parsing and `highlight.js` for code syntax highlighting.

The solution adheres to modern web development best practices, including a responsive design, semantic HTML5, and a clean user interface, all contained within a single HTML file without external dependencies or CDN links.

### Features
*   **Markdown to HTML Conversion**: Automatically converts the embedded `input.md` content into HTML.
*   **Syntax Highlighting**: Code blocks within the Markdown are automatically styled with syntax highlighting using `highlight.js` (GitHub theme).
*   **Single File, No Dependencies**: All necessary CSS and JavaScript libraries (`marked.js`, `highlight.js`, and its theme) are embedded directly into the HTML file.
*   **Modern & Responsive Design**: The page features a clean, professional look and adapts seamlessly to various screen sizes, from mobile devices to desktops.
*   **Semantic HTML5**: Uses appropriate HTML5 elements for structure and accessibility.
*   **Professional UI/UX**: Designed for readability and ease of use with a carefully chosen color scheme and typography.

### How to Use
1.  **Save the file**: Save the provided HTML code as an `.html` file (e.g., `index.html`).
2.  **Open in browser**: Open the `index.html` file using any modern web browser.
3.  **View Content**: The page will automatically render the Markdown content (from the `markdownContent` variable in the script) as HTML, including any code blocks with syntax highlighting, within the `#markdown-output` section.

To change the Markdown content, simply edit the `markdownContent` JavaScript variable within the `<script>` tag. For example, to revert to the exact `input.md` of 'hi!', change `const markdownContent = `# a`;` to `const markdownContent = `hi!`;`.

### Technologies Used
*   **HTML5**: For semantic page structure.
*   **CSS3**: For styling, including responsive design (mobile-first approach), typography, and color scheme.
*   **JavaScript (ES6+)**: For dynamic content manipulation and integration of the Markdown and highlighting libraries.
*   **Marked.js (v6.0.0)**: A fast Markdown parser and compiler written in JavaScript. Embedded directly.
*   **Highlight.js (v11.9.0)**: A syntax highlighter for the web. Embedded directly with the GitHub theme.
